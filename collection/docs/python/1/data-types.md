# Data Types

## Numbers

- Integers (int): Whole numbers.
- Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with a decimal point.

```py
x = 5      # int
y = 3.14   # float
```

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters.

```py
text = 'Hello, World!'
```

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items which can be of any data type.

```py
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

```py
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

```py
student_scores = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 85, 'Charlie': 92}
```

## Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```py
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Booleans

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

```py
is_valid = True
```

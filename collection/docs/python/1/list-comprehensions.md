# List comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They are often used to make code more readable and expressive.

```py
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- Expression: The value or operation that will be added to the list.
- Item: The variable representing each element in the iterable.
- Iterable: The collection (list, tuple, set, etc.) to iterate over.
- Condition (Optional): A filter to include only elements that meet a certain criterion.

## Performance Considerations

List comprehensions are not just syntactic sugar; they can be more efficient than traditional for-loops because they are optimized internally. However, readability and maintainability should always be considered, especially for more complex comprehensions.
